## Prerequisities

`Python Dependencies`
* python3-flask
* python3-flask-sqlalchemy

Python 3 and Flask are required to run applications. Later exercises may require additional python dependencies to function.

For PIP use of `virtualenv` is strongly recommended when installing python dependencies. Additionally `virtualenvwrapper` is recommended for controlling these enviroments. 

Install dependencies for development enviroment:

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
