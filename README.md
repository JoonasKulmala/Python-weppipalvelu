## Prerequisities

Python 3 and Flask are required to run programs. Later exercises may require additional python dependencies to function.

    # Install Flask using apt
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-flask

For PIP use of `virtualenv` is strongly recommended when installing python dependencies. Additionally `virtualenvwrapper` is recommended for controlling these enviroments. 

Install dependencies for development enviroment:

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
